# ContractReviewerAssistant

You can use this code to review your contract and output the review results, including risk clauses, due diligence, etc.

Before the main review, you need to obtain the API from the Qichacha network.

Once everything is ready, run the run.py file to start the service, and then you can run the ui.py file for the front-end page display.

I wish you a pleasant experience, please leave a message if you have any questions.
